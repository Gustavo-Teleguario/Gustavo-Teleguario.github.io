I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything

of what each of the values mean.

    bio: <p>My name is Maynor Gustavo, and I from Guatemala. Ever since my early years, curiosity has been my driving
        force, and in the course of these recent years, I've nurtured a diverse array of skills. Among them lies the art
        of
        effective communication and seamless integration into any environment. Thus, when I ventured to Germany, it
        posed a formidable
        challenge, but one I met with unwavering determination. Over the past decade, I've been dedicated to pursuing my
        studies in Computer Science at the University of
        Kassel. This period has not only been about academic growth but also about harmonizing my studies with
        professional experience. I've concurrently engaged with
        various companies, reaping invaluable work insights and fostering novel knowledge. At present, I find myself in
        the role of a Software Developer at <a href={'https://www.comtec.eecs.uni-kassel.de/'}>ComTec University of
            Kassel</a>,
        a journey that has further ignited my profound passion for the realm of software.
        Amidst this professional journey, I also cultivate a rich personal life, where I wholeheartedly embrace my
        cherished hobbies.</p>,
